This is a sample post to show how markdown tables look in the blog layout.

## Comparison Table

Here's how different video creation methods stack up:

| Method | Time to Create | Cost | Scalability | Quality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional Studio | 2–4 weeks | $5,000–$50,000 | Low | High |
| Freelancer | 1–2 weeks | $500–$5,000 | Medium | Variable |
| DIY Screen Recording | 1–2 hours | Free | Medium | Low |
| AI Video (Colossyan) | 5–15 minutes | Subscription | High | High |

As the table shows, AI video generation dramatically reduces both time and cost while maintaining quality.
